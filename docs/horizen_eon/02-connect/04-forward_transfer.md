title: Forward Transfer
---

A forward transfer transaction consists of moving assets from the mainchain to a sidechain (EON). 

**Note:** The EON address can be used in any EVM-compatible crypto wallet such as Cobalt, MetaMask, and the like.


## Before You Start

Before performing a forward transfer of assets, make sure that the following is available:



* Crypto wallet account (EON address)
* Crypto wallet configured to the** Horizen EON** network
* Sufficient funds (balance) in your Horizen Sphere account


## Send ZEN

To send ZEN from the Horizen mainchain to EON, use Sphere:
