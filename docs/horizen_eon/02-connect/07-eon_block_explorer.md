title: Horizen EON Explorer
---



The Horizen EON Explorer leverages the feature-rich Blockscout Explorer, an online tool for inspecting and analyzing the Horizen EON blockchain. Blockscout is open-source code that allows the ability to customize a block explorer instance to view all transactions, past and current, on the blockchain. Customization options include information such as the network's hash rate and transaction details.

**Note:** Use **Search** to query for a specific transaction, address (wallet or contract), block, and token.



## Key Features

The key features of the Horizen EON Block Explorer are modularized in each of the panels in the main landing page.

## Block Explorer Features

The EON Block Explorer gives you the ability to search the blockchain for transactions, addresses, and statistics, including the customized features of:

- Backward Transfer
- Forward Transfer
- Fee Payment


Typically, when a user decides to move ZEN from a sidechain back to the mainchain (to either send ZEN to another sidechain or to cash out, for example) the backward transfer transaction is deployed. Backward transfers are initiated on EON (EVM sidechain) as special transactions batched in withdrawal certificates and propagated by EON nodes to the mainchain.

The EON Block Explorer highlights the Backward Transfer transaction:

<p>
<img src={require("/img/docs/blockscout/gobi-exp-backward.png").default} alt="backward-transaction" width="900" height="700" />
</p>

Key information includes:

- **Txn hash** - The unique identifier that validates the transaction.
- **Method** - In the case of backward transfers the method is always backwardTransfer.
- **From** - The sending address of the transaction.
- **To** - In the case of backward transfers the destination address is the Withdrawal Request native contract.
- **Value tZEN** - The amount of TZEN transferred in the transaction.
- **Fee tZEN** - The TZEN amount charged to process the transaction.

### Forward Transfer

When a user requests for TZEN from the Horizen Faucet, the forward transfer transaction is initiated. A forward transfer moves assets from the mainchain to the sidechain. These transactions, more specifically the transaction outputs, are unspendable on the mainchain. However, they include some metadata so they are redeemable on EON. 

It is the responsibility of EON nodes to monitor the mainchain for incoming transactions, and include them in EON.

The EON Block Explorer lists the Forward Transfer transaction:

<p>
<img src={require("/img/docs/blockscout/gobi-exp-forward.png").default} alt="forward-transaction" width="900" height="700" />
</p>

Key information includes:

- **Block** - The number assigned to the block.
- **Elapsed timer for the block** - A timer that displays the elapsed time since the block creation.
- **To** - The recipient address of the forward transfer.
- **Value tZEN** - The amount of TZEN transferred in the forward transfer.

### Fee Payment

The blockchain fee is a ZEN-denoted fee that users are charged when processing transactions. The fee is required to process the transaction on Horizen EON and ensures that transfers arrive at their expected destination. The fees are aggregated and paid to forger nodes that have forged at least one block during the last withdrawal epoch.

The EON Block Explorer lists the Fee Payment transactions:

<p>
<img src={require("/img/docs/blockscout/gobi-exp-fee.png").default} alt="fee-payment" width="900" height="700" />

### Validated Transactions
Transaction validation indicates that a transaction conforms to a specific protocol requirement to deem it as valid. Once the transaction is considered valid, it is added to the distributed ledger.

The **Validated Transaction** feature provides key information about the transaction.
