# What is Staking?
Staking is the mechanism that a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain offers to participate actively in the network consensus.

To be an active participant, a user must lock a certain amount of coins, thereby becoming a _Forger_. The higher the amount staked, the greater the chances of being able to create (_forge_) a block. 

As long as the amount is staked, the user cannot dispose of it.  

Once the stake amount is un-staked, the user can then dispose that certain amount.
