# How to Stake on EON
A forger is required to run a node. See [How to Locally Build and Deploy](../04-develop_and_deploy_smart_contracts/04-local_build_and_deploy.md) and [Forger Node Requirements](./04-forger_node.md) for information on creating and running a node.  

The following steps require some basic general knowledge; a web application for staking is under construction and will be made available soon.

## Forger Node instructions
Please follow the instructions on [this page](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/compose-evm-simplified?tab=readme-ov-file#running-a-forger-node) to set up a forger node.
