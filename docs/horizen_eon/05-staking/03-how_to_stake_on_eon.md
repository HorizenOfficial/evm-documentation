# How to Stake on EON
You can stake ZEN on EON Forger nodes to participate in network security. Please stake to to a known forger node using the instructions noted in the section labeled Stake ZEN to Your Forger in the Forger Node tutorial. Note that this will instead be someone else's forger node instead of your own.

If you would like to set up your own forger node, please refer to the following docs [here](/horizen_eon/tutorials/forger_node_setup_guide).
