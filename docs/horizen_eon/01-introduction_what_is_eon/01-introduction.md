EON is Horizen's Ethereum Virtual Machine. EON has adopted Ethereum’s Account-based transaction model to represent assets as balances within accounts. The Account model, in VM capable blockchains, differentiate account types on whether they represent a _normal_ account balance or an account which is bound to some **code** that has to be executed by the VM (Virtual Machine). The conventional terminology to differentiate those is: 
- **Externally Owned Account** (**EOA**) 
- **Contract** account


In both cases, the account has a balance.
