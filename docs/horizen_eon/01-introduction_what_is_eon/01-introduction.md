| EON is compatible with **EVM Paris**. You must use compiler versions up to **v0.8.19**. Otherwise, the deployment will fail. The next release of EON will port **EVM Shanghai** compatibility and will be announced at a future date.      |


EON is Horizen's Ethereum Virtual Machine. EON has adopted Ethereumâ€™s Account-based transaction model to represent assets as balances within accounts. The Account model, in VM capable blockchains, differentiate account types on whether they represent a _normal_ account balance or an account which is bound to some **code** that has to be executed by the VM (Virtual Machine). The conventional terminology to differentiate those is:
- **Externally Owned Account** (**EOA**)
- **Contract** account


In both cases, the account has a balance.
