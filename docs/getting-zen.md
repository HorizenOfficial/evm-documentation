# Getting ZEN
*$ZEN (Cryptocurrency) is needed to develop, stake or perform transactions on EON EVM. Learn how to get ZEN into an account.*


# Deposit ZEN into your account

You can choose one of the two options below to deposit some test ZEN into an account:


* Go to the **_[Faucet](https://faucet.horizen.io/) - _**and get some free test ZEN.
* Make a *_Forward Transfer_* - The forward transfer is the process of transferring assets from the mainchain to the sidechain.

The first option is faster and it’s available for testing purposes (in **Testnet**, without real value), while the other option is moving a balance of ZEN from the Horizen mainchain to EON EVM and is available on [Sphere](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/Sphere_by_Horizen/), our desktop wallet.

**Important:** Using a Smart Contract address as target of the Forward Transfer (FT) will lead to a loss of ZEN.
