# Getting ZEN

_$ZEN (Cryptocurrency) is needed to develop, stake, or perform transactions on EON EVM. Learn how to get ZEN into an account._


## Add ZEN to Wallet

In order to deploy a smart contract, the account (in the wallet) that is associated with EON EVM requires some amount of currency for transactions. You can add TZEN to your wallet by using the **Horizen Faucet**.

Perform the following steps to add TZEN to your wallet:



1. In your MetaMask wallet, copy the **wallet address** to the clipboard.
2. Click the link for the Horizen [Faucet](https://faucet.horizen.io). The **Horizen Test Token Faucet** page appears:

3. In the **Select Testnet** field, use the pull-down menu and select **Dune Testnet**.
4. In the Wallet Address field, paste your MetaMask wallet address.
5. Click **Request 0.51 TZEN**.
6. After a few minutes, check your MetaMask wallet for** TZEN**.

## Deposit ZEN into an account

You can choose one of the two options below to deposit some test ZEN into an account:



* Go to the **_[Faucet](https://faucet.horizen.io/) - _**and get some free test ZEN.
* Make a *_Forward Transfer - _* The forward transfer is the process of transferring assets from the mainchain to the sidechain.

The first option is faster and itâ€™s available for testing purposes (in **Testnet**, without real value), while the other option is moving a balance of ZEN from the Horizen *_mainchain _* to EON EVM and is available on [Sphere](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/Sphere_by_Horizen/), our desktop wallet.

**Important:** Using a Smart Contract address as target of the Forward Transfer (FT) will lead to a loss of ZEN.
