# Build

*Learn how to write smart contracts and get basic information from EON EVM.*


## Smart Contracts

There are many development environment tools you can use in creating and deploying a smart contract. For EON, the use of **Truffle**, **Hardhat**, or **Remix IDE** are highly recommended.

This section shows how *__Truffle__* is used for implementing the smart contract examples.

## Building Smart Contracts: Using Truffle

Use Truffle to create and deploy smart contracts. Truffle is a development environment where you can develop smart contracts with its built-in testing framework, smart contract compilation, deployment, and interactive console.

### Prerequisites

To deploy a smart contract, complete the steps below:



* Install Truffle 
* Create a project contract 
* Compile a contract
* Test a contract



### Install Truffle

Install the following to your localhost:

**NodeJS (v18.0) **-  Install the long-term support (LTS) version. This bundle includes **NPM**.

To install **NodeJS** in your local system, perform the following steps:

1. Download the installer from [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) website.
2. Run the installer.
3. Follow the steps, agree on the license agreement.
4. Restart your local system.


**Note:** Do not use the sudo command to install Truffle. It may cause permission errors to occur.


```
npm install -g truffle
```


To confirm that Truffle is installed correctly, run the command:


```
truffle version
```



### Create a Project

Use the <strong><code>truffle init</code></strong> command to create the project folder and subfolders to put your Truffle project. In your localhost, perform the following commands:


```
mkdir truffle-project
cd truffle-project
truffle init
```

Next, go to the `truffle-project/contracts` directory for your smart contract(s). Use the following sample contract, **DemoToken.sol**:


```
//SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
 
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
 
contract DemoToken is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("Demo Token", "DEMO"){
        // mint 100 tokens to the sender on deployment
        _mint(msg.sender, 100);
    }
}

```

**Note**: Make sure that the Solidity version (example: <code>solidity ^0.8.0;</code>) corresponds to the version in <code>truffle.config.js</code>.

Near the top of the sample contract is an import statement for the **ERC20** contract, which **DemoToken** inherits. Use NPM to install the contract. Run the command:

```
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```



### Compile a Contract

To compile the sample contract, <strong><code>DemoToken.sol</code></strong>, go to the <code>contracts/</code> directory and run the command:


```
truffle compile
```


You should see:


```
Compiling your contracts...
===========================
 
 
> Compiling ./contracts/DemoToken.sol
> Artifacts written to /Users/<home>/…/contracts
> Compiled successfully using:
- solc: 0.8.13+commit.abaa5c0e.Emscripten.clang

```



### Support for the ZEN Network

A network is needed in order to deploy a smart contract. In the configuration file, **truffle-config.js** (below), add in the network section with the following:


```
…networks: {    
	zen: {
		provider: () => new HDWalletProvider("word1 … word12", `https://evm-tn-m2.horizenlabs.io/ethv1`),
      network_id: 1661,  
      production: false
    }
…
```


**Note**: In the account field, replace “**word1 … word12**” with a mnemonic seed phrase for a valid wallet. Use the following [instructions](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015290032-How-to-reveal-your-Secret-Recovery-Phrase) to retrieve your mnemonic seed phrase from MetaMask.

The <code>network_id</code> is dependent on the environment in use and corresponds to the Chain ID. For Dune Testnet, the Chain ID is **1661**.

Next, add this line at the top of the file:

```// const HDWalletProvider = require('@truffle/hdwallet-provider');```

**Note**: The [Truffle HDWallet Provider](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg0S8f0aKUltwQyMPZiAlSzXgWuv4dbWV8G140EfLPc/edit#heading=h.a5ho8bfasvz3) helps in configuring the network connection as well as to sign transactions for addresses derived from the 12-word mnemonic.

Then, use NPM to install HDWallet Provider by running the command:

```
npm install @truffle/hdwallet-provider
```



## Set EON EVM as Network Provider

Set EON EVM as the network provider to get an interactive console to execute commands.

Run the command:


```
truffle console --network zen
```



### Get Basic Information

Use the interactive console to get basic information for the following:


#### Block Height


```
truffle(zen)> web3.eth.getBlockNumber()
2976
```



#### Chain ID 


```
truffle(zen)> web3.eth.getChainId()
1661
```



#### Gas Cost


```
truffle(zen)> web3.eth.getGasPrice()
"7"
```
