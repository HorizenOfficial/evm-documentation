# Run a forger node

### The difference between a forger and a regular node
A regular node plays a more passive role in the network; it receives the transactions from the neighbors peers, forwards them and validate transactions and blocks before including them in the mempool and history.  
As we said in the previous chapter, a forger participate actively in the network consensus by forging blocks.
To become a forger, the user must stake ZEN.
