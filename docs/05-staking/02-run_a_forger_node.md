## Run a forger node

### The difference between a forger and a regular node
A regular node plays a more passive role in the network; it receives the transactions from the neighbors peers, forwards them and validate transactions and blocks before including them in the mempool and history. \
A forger node, in addition to performing the same actions, can also contribute actively by creating (forging) new blocks. In order to do so the user must stake ZEN.
