## What is staking?
Staking is the mechanism a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain offers to participate actively in the network consensus.
To do so, a user has to lock a certain amount of coins; by doing so they become _Forger_. The higher the amount staked, the greater the chances of being able to create (_forge_) a block. 
As long as the amount is staked, the user cannot dispose of it. \
The staked amount can be un-staked and the user can again dispose of such amount.
