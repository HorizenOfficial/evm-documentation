title: Communication Channels

* **Discord**: [LINK] Discord is a social media and messaging application that serves as the main communications platform for Horizen. Anyone is free to join the official Horizen server and engage in discussion with other community members across any of the channels.
* **Discourse**: [LINK] Discourse is the first stop for proposals. It is an open forum for governance-related discussions. It is where $ZEN tokenholders can create ZenIPs and EONIPs, view current and past proposals, and comment on proposals. Members of the Horizen community must register for an account before contributing and engaging with posts.

* **Snapshot**: [LINK] Snapshot is an off-chain voting interface that allows the community to vote on ZenIPs and EONIPs that have reached the voting stage. Voting power is based on the amount of $ZEN held, and delegate voting power to a different delegate.
