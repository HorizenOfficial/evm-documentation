title: Delegation of Votes
---

As a token holder, you can create or vote on governance proposals in the Horizen DAO. However, there are circumstances, for example, funds in a cold wallet, in which voting with another wallet may be more convenient or where you need the collective to meet the requirements to open a new proposal. You can still voice your vote by delegating your voting power to another party via the crypto wallet address of the delegate. 

## Before You Start

Make sure that you know the wallet address of the person you wish to delegate your voting power.

**Note:** The **MetaMask** crypto wallet is used in this example.

# Delegate Your Vote

1. Open the [Delegate](https://snapshot.org/#/delegate/horizenfoundation.eth) tab to delegate your vote.

2. Click **Connect Wallet**. 

    **Note:** Make sure that your crypto wallet is configured to the **Ethereum Mainnet** network.

3. In the **To** field, enter the delegateâ€™s **crypto wallet address** or **Ethereum Name Service (ENS)** name.

4. **(Optional)** If you decide to **enable** the slider to **Limit the delegations to a specific space**, you need to do this for each delegation sub-spaces. One for **horizenfoundationtechnical.eth** sub-space and for the **horizenfoundationnontechnical.eth** sub-space. The **Space** field becomes active.

5. In the **Space** field, enter the name of the sub-space for each Horizen Foundation (**horizenfoundationtechnical.eth** and **horizenfoundationnontechnical.eth**).

6. The **Top delegates** field displays the current delegation for the Horizen Foundation.

7. Click **Confirm**.

**Note:** In case the delegate and the delegator both cast their respective vote, the delegation is not counted, thus resulting in a temporary re-appropriation of voting power for that particular proposal. 


### Approved for Voting

Your ZENIP/EONIP is now approved for voting and is tallied to a live ([Snapshot Vote](https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth)https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth).
