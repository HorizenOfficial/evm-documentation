title: Linking Mainchain and EON $ZEN Addresses
---

Because Snapshot is not compatible with Horizen’s mainchain, it has been integrated into EON, which is Ethereum-compatible. This means that $ZEN tokenholders will need to “link” their mainchain $ZEN address with an EON address in order to capture their full voting power for proposals in Snapshot.
