title: Proposal Phases
---

This page gives an overview of the purpose of each phase of the proposal process. Please see the Constitution of the Horizen DAO [LINK] for more detail.

<u>Phase 1: Proposal Idea and Research</u>
<p></p>
The person or people with an idea for a proposal check discussions on official channels to determine whether the idea has been previously proposed. Any idea must either 1) have not been proposed before; or 2) be substantially different than an idea that has been previously proposed but not approved, such that there is a high likelihood of success during a community vote. As long as one of these criteria is met, an idea may then be posted to Discourse using the template outlined in the Constitution.
<p></p>
<u>Phase 2: Idea Modification</u>
<p></p>
Once an idea is posted to Discourse, the moderator will confirm that is adheres to DAO guidelines before being made public on Discourse. Any changes to the idea at that point may only be made via the comments to the published idea on Discourse, and comments must be flagged as “official” changes, as submitters will not have the opportunity to modify a proposal idea once submitted to the moderator for publication. 
<p></p>
<u>Phase 3: Community Feedback</u>
<p></p>
Once an idea has been approved for publication by the Discourse moderator, community members will have a seven day window to provide feedback on the proposal via the comment section. This is an opportunity for the submitter to engage with the community and anticipate the ways in which the community may (or may not) welcome the proposal before it is put towards a vote.
<p></p>
<u>Phase 4: Proposal Draft Creation</u>
<p></p>
After the community review and feedback period, a proposed idea moves to the draft stage. The submitter(s) must follow the template laid out in the Constitution of the Horizen DAO.
<p></p>
<u>Phase 5: Draft Review and Moderator Feedback</u>
<p></p>

<ul type="none">
  <li>
    <b>a. ZenIP/EONIP Draft Review and Moderator Feedback</b>
    <p></p>
    Once your ZenIP/EONIP draft has been posted, the moderator(s) will ensure that your draft correctly follows the template. The moderator(s) will also have the opportunity to request additional information from you via private messaging on Discourse. If you do not respond to the moderator’s request for feedback or additional information within 30 days from receipt of the moderator’s request, your ZenIP/EONIP draft will be automatically rejected.
    <p></p>
    If your draft ZenIP/EONIP conforms to this Constitution and the ZenIP/EONIP format, the moderator will assign your draft a proposal number.
  </li>

  <li>
    <p></p>
    <b>b. Administrative Review</b>
    <p></p>
    Participation in decentralized governance is critical to the direction and success of the Horizen DAO and ecosystem. ZenIPs/EONIPs play a significant role in the system of decentralization. As such, all ZenIPs/EONIPs must undergo administrative review by the Special Council, which is made up of 7 members from the Horizen community. For more information on the Special Council, including the Horizen DAO’s ability to elect Special Council members, please see further below in this Constitution. The Special Council will determine whether additional information or clarification is needed before your ZenIP/EONIP can be moved to a vote.
    <p></p>
    During this review, the Special Council may tag your ZenIP/EONIP “return for clarification” for the following reasons:
    <p></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Cost to implement is unclear or unable to be calculated;</li>
      <li>Proposal would use more than 10% of the DAO’s public treasury;</li>
      <li>Proposal conflicts with another proposal;</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    Your proposal may also be tagged as “return for reconsideration,” for reasons including but not limited to:
    <p></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Proposal violates or threatens the mission or values of the Horizen DAO, whether financially or through a proposed significant deviation from the mission of the Foundation;</li>
      <li>Proposal has the potential to harm the Horizen DAO or the Foundation, whether financially or through a proposed significant deviation from the mission of the Foundation;</li>
      <li>Proposal might violate law or otherwise contradict advice of counsel for the Foundation. If a proposal is suspected to violate the law or otherwise contradict the advice of counsel for the Foundation, the Foundation directors will confer with external counsel to confirm;</li>
      <li>There is reasonable suspicion of fraud or other misleading information in the ZenIP/EONIP.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    There is a maximum of three (3) revisions permitted following tags and comments from the Special Council. If your ZenIP/EONIP draft fails to satisfy the requirements after three (3) turns of revisions and comments, it will be rejected, and you will have to resubmit your proposal from the ZenIP/EONIP Idea stage.
    <p></p>
    If additional information is not needed, your ZenIP/EONIP will proceed to the voting stage. During the period, the Special Council meets at least once a month to review draft proposals that are being elevated to the voting stage. This process is in place to ensure the continued security of the Horizen DAO, Foundation, and community.
    <p></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p></p>
    <b>c. Vote</b>
    <p></p>
    Now that your ZenIP/EONIP has been approved for voting, it will go to a live Snapshot vote. Voting can be accessed at this link: [ENTER LINK]. As a $ZEN tokenholder, you can participate in this Snapshot voting.
    <p></p>
    ZenIPs/EONIPs are divided into two main categories, that each have their own requirements for adoption subject to a vote, in addition to the above requirements for drafting and submitting the proposals before they are put to a vote.
    <p></p>
    <ul type="none">
      <li>
        <b>i. Non-Technical ZenIP/EONIP</b>
        <p></p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Majority: The proposal must receive more votes in favor than against to pass; and</li>
          <li>Quorum: There must be at least 5% of total supply of $ZEN participating in the vote.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p></p>
        <b>ii. Technical ZenIP/EONIP</b>
        <p></p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Majority: Of the total votable $ZEN tokens participating in the vote, the proposal must receive at least 67% votes in favor of the proposal to pass; and</li>
          <li>Quorum: There must be at least 10% of total supply of $ZEN participating in the vote.</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        To vote on a proposal using a wallet that contains delegating voting power, you must login to [LINK]. $ZEN tokens that are delegated must have been delegated to the wallet address that is voting before the voting period begins.
        <p></p>
        Voting remains open for a period of 72 hours. At this time, anyone who meets the qualifications to vote may vote once for every $ZEN contained in (or delegated to) the wallet they are voting from. Following 72 hours, voting closes, and no more votes may be cast.
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p></p>
        <b>iii. Tie Votes or Conflicts</b>
        <p></p>
        If there is a tie in votes for Non-Technical ZenIP/EONIPs, then such ZenIP/EONIP will be sent back to a community discussion phase for community members to discuss their differences or comprehension of the effects and purposes of the proposal and then put to a revote. A ZenIP/EONIP can only be sent back to the community discussion phase three (3) times before the proposal is automatically rejected and will need to be resubmitted starting from the ZenIP/EONIP Idea Stage.
        <p></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p></p>
    <b>d. Cooldown Period</b>
    <p></p>
    A ZenIP/EONIP that passes must undergo a final review to ensure the proposal does not violate the Foundation Govening Documents, any laws, or otherwise jeopardizes the safety and security of the Horizen DAO or Foundation. The director(s) of the Horizen Foundation will review a ZenIP/EONIP within 30 days from its passing. If the director(s) of the Foundation are satisfied that no issues exist with implementing the approved ZenIP/EONIP, it moves towards implementation.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p></p>
    <b>e. Implementation</b>
    <p></p>
    All ZenIPs/EONIPs that satisfy their voting approval thresholds, as described above, in addition to the other requirements specified in this Constitution, may be implemented in the following ways:
    <p></p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>
        <p></p>
        <b>Technical ZenIP/EONIP</b>
        <p></p>
        <ul type="circle">
          <li>
            Upon approval of any Technical ZenIP/EONIP by the Horizen DAO, the Foundation will merge the approved ZenIP/EONIP into the Horizen Github repository for release as part of a new software version. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Ultimate implementation of a Technical ZenIP or EONIP which seeks to implement technical upgrades or changes will depend on the decision of a majority of network participants (miners and node operators) to run the new software version.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p></p>
        <b>Non-Technical ZenIP/EONIP</b>
        <p></p>
        <ul type="circle">
          <li>
            The Foundation and the DAO administrator will assist in implementing approved Non-Technical ZenIPs/EONIPs, including hiring or engaging service providers, coordinating documentation and contract negotiations and all other actions incidental to implementing the approved Non-Technical ZenIPs/EONIPs.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Horizen DAO administrator and/or project management team will assist with the above implementations but are not responsible for this on their own.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ul>
