title: Get TZEN from the Faucet
---


You can choose one of the two options below to deposit some test ZEN into an account:



* Go to the **_[Horizen Faucet](https://faucet.horizen.io/) - _** and get some free test ZEN.
* Make a *_Forward Transfer - _* The forward transfer is the process of transferring assets from the mainchain to the sidechain.

The first option is faster and itâ€™s available for testing purposes (in **Gobi Testnet**, without real value), while the second option moves a balance of ZEN from the Horizen *_mainchain _* to EON EVM.  Use Horizen [Sphere](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/Sphere_by_Horizen/) to make a forward transfer.

**Important:** Using a Smart Contract address as target of the Forward Transfer (FT) will lead to a loss of ZEN.
