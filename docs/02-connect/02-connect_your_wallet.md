You can add a network to your MetaMask wallet by specifying the RPC endpoint and Chain ID to make a connection. Perform the following steps to make a connection.  Use the table (below) to enter the appropriate values.



1. To add a network connection, click on the **network menu** at the top right of your MetaMask wallet.

2. The **Settings** page appears. At the bottom of the page, click **Add a network manually**.
3. The **Add a network manually** page appears. Enter the following fields with the appropriate values:

  **Network name** - The name of network to add

  **New RPC URL** - The URL address for remote procedure call (RPC server).

  **Chain ID** - The chain ID of the network to add.

  **Currency  symbol** - The currency symbol supported by the network. 

  **Note:** When you get free ZEN from the Horizen Faucet, you are actually receiving **TZEN**, as it is required for the **Gobi Testnet** network.

  **Block explorer URL** - Optionally, add the URL address of the supported block explorer.
