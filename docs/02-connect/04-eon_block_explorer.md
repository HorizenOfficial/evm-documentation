title: Horizen EON Explorer
---



The Horizen EON Explorer (Gobi Testnet Block Explorer) leverages the feature-rich Blockscout Explorer, an online tool for inspecting and analyzing the Gobi Testnet blockchain. Blockscout is open-source code that allows the ability to customize a block explorer instance to view all transactions, past and current, on the blockchain. Customization options include information such as the network's hash rate and transaction details.

**Note:** Use **Search** to query for a specific transaction, address (wallet or contract), block, and token.



## Key Features

The key features of the Gobi Testnet Block Explorer are modularized in each of the panels in the main landing page. 

### Daily Transaction

The **Daily Transaction** dashboard provides a real-time view of the blockchain with various data points.

<p>
<img src={require("/img/docs/blockscout/gobi-exp-daily.png").default} alt="daily-transaction" width="900" height="700" />
</p>

The categories in the Daily Transaction dashboard includes:

- A **graph view** of transactions processed during a time period. It includes metrics for tracking gas and transactions on a daily basis.
- **Average block time** - This is the average time that a block is created.
- **Total transactions** - The total number of transactions in a time period in the blockchain.
- **Total blocks** - The total number of blocks in the blockchain.
- **Wallet address** - The total number of wallet addresses associated with transactions in the blockchain.

### Blocks

The Block module provides key information about the block.

<p>
<img src={require("/img/docs/blockscout/gobi-exp-blocks.png").default} alt="blocks-module" width="900" height="700" />
</p>

Key information includes:

- **Block number** - The number assigned to the block.
- **Number of transactions** - The running number of transactions for the block.
- **Number of bytes** - The amount of bytes for the block.
- **Elapsed timer for the block** - A timer that displays the elapsed time since the block creation.

- **Miner (wallet) address** - The minerâ€™s address. Click the miner's address link to navigate to the **Address Detail** page.

### Transactions

The **Transaction** module provides key information about the transaction.

<p>
<img src={require("/img/docs/blockscout/gobi-exp-transactions.png").default} alt="transactions" width="900" height="700" />
</p>

Key information includes:

- **Transaction Status** - Indicates the status (Success or Error) details of the transaction.
- **Transaction ID (hash)** - The unique identifier that validates the transaction.
- **Address** - The wallet address associated with the transaction. 
- **Transaction Fee** - The amount charged to process the transaction.

## Block Explorer Features

The EON Block Explorer gives you the ability to search the blockchain for transactions, addresses, and statistics, including the customized features of:

- Backward Transfer
- Forward Transfer
- Fee Payment


Typically, when a user decides to move ZEN from a sidechain back to the mainchain (to either send ZEN to another sidechain or to cash out, for example) the backward transfer transaction is deployed. Backward transfers are initiated on EON (EVM sidechain) as special transactions batched in withdrawal certificates and propagated by EON nodes to the mainchain.

The EON Block Explorer highlights the Backward Transfer transaction:

<p>
<img src={require("/img/docs/blockscout/gobi-exp-backward.png").default} alt="backward-transaction" width="900" height="700" />
</p>

Key information includes:

- **Transaction Status** - Indicates the status (Success or Error) details of the transaction.
- **Transaction ID (hash)** - The unique identifier that validates the transaction. Click the transaction ID link to navigate to the **Transaction Detail** page.
- **(Sending) Address** - The sending address of the transaction. Click the address receiving asset link navigate to the to **Address Detail** page.
- **Amount of tZEN** - The amount of tZEN transferred in the transaction.
- **Transaction Fee** - The amount charged to process the transaction.
- **Block Number** - The number assigned to the block.
- **Elapsed timer for the block** - A timer that displays the elapsed time since the block creation.

### Forward Transfer

When a user requests for tZEN from the Horizen Faucet, the forward transfer transaction is initiated. A forward transfer moves assets from the mainchain to the sidechain. These transactions, more specifically the transaction outputs, are unspendable on the mainchain. However, they include some metadata so they are redeemable on EON. 

It is the responsibility of EON nodes to monitor the mainchain for incoming transactions, and include them in EON.

The EON Block Explorer highlights the Forward Transfer transaction:

<p>
<img src={require("/img/docs/blockscout/gobi-exp-forward.png").default} alt="forward-transaction" width="900" height="700" />

- **Amount of tZEN** - The amount of tZEN transferred in the transaction.
- **Block Number** - The number assigned to the block.
- **Elapsed timer for the block** - A timer that displays the elapsed time since the block creation.

### Fee Payment

The blockchain fee is a tZEN-denoted fee that users are charged when processing transactions. The fee is required to process the transaction on the Gobi Testnet and ensure that transfers arrive at their expected destination. The fees are aggregated and paid to forger nodes that have forged at least one block during the last withdrawal epoch.


The EON Block Explorer highlights the Fee Payment transactions:

<p>
