# Deploy
*Learn how to deploy a simple Solidity-based smart contract in Dune Testnet using the Truffle framework.*


Once the DemoToken contract is successfully compiled, it can now be deployed. 
However, before deploying, make sure that the account you plan to use has sufficient ZEN. See [Get Started](/#connect-to-a-wallet) to install the MetaMask wallet, if needed. To deploy a contract on Dune Testnet, your account must have sufficient ZEN. You can get some free test ZEN by using the [**Faucet**](https://faucet.horizen.io/).


Add the deployment script, [1_deploy_DEMOToken.js](https://github.com/rocknitive/zen-sidechain-truffle/blob/master/migrations/1_deploy_DemoToken.js)  (below) in the `/migrations` folder:


```
const DemoToken = artifacts.require("DemoToken");

module.exports = function(deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(DemoToken);
};
```


Next, deploy the contract by running the command:


```
truffle migrate --network zen
```



## Interact with a Contract Instance

To interact with your deployed contract, you first need to get the contract instance. First, run the truffle console again by running the command:

```
truffle console --network zen
```

Then get the contract instance by running the command:
```
truffle(zen)> const contract = await DemoToken.deployed()
```


Next, you will get some information from the ERC20 contract by calling the token methods from [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20). Be aware of the method names by looking at the ABI of the contract or look at the code itself. 


### Get the token name


```
truffle(zen)> contract.name()
'Demo Token'
```



### Get the token symbol


```
truffle(zen)> contract.symbol()
'DEMO'
```



### Get the account balance 

In this example, use the main (first) account, where 20 bytes of an account can be directly specified. 


```
truffle(zen)> const myAccounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts()
truffle(zen)> contract.balanceOf(myAccounts[0])
BN {
  negative: 0,
  words: [ 100, <1 empty item> ],
  length: 1,
  red: null
}
```



### Send token to an account 

Send 12 tokens to the following account:


```
0x03f14683E2f95883815f0df3C9145Efe24575163
```


Here is the code:


```
truffle(zen)> contract.transfer("0x03f14683E2f95883815f0df3C9145Efe24575163", 12)
{
  tx: '0xa19ffcb54152804ed10c778828215d505656d7a112921f11e7c9ffb47c749341',
  receipt: ...,
  logs: ...
}
```


The balance is now reduced by 12 (tokens):


```
truffle(zen)> contract.balanceOf(myAccounts[0])
BN { negative: 0, words: [ 88, <1 empty item> ], length: 1, red: null }
```


 


## EOA to EOA transactions 

Send ZEN from the main address to a known address.


```
truffle(zen)> web3.eth.sendTransaction({ from: myAccounts[0], to: "0x03f14683E2f95883815f0df3C9145Efe24575163", value: 100 })
{

  status: true,
  effectiveGasPrice: 2500000007
}

```



## Interact with native smart contracts 

There is no difference between interacting with an abstraction of a native smart contract (abstract contract or child contract created from base contract) and a traditional smart contract. In this example, you will send ZEN from an EON EVM address to the Horizen mainchain for two main functionalities (backward transfer and forgers) provided through native smart contracts.

To interact with the native contract, you will use the function, **backward transfer** (also called, **withdrawal request**) at the reserved address as:

<strong><code>0x0000000000000000000011111111111111111111</code></strong> 

You can also send ZEN using the smart contract address and the ABI. In this example, the Solidity file, **WithdrawalRequests.sol** (below) is used to demonstrate the interaction.

You can obtain a copy of the [WithdrawalRequests.sol](https://github.com/rocknitive/zen-sidechain-truffle/blob/master/contracts/WithdrawalRequests.sol) file and put it in the <code>/contracts</code> folder. 

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

type MCAddress is bytes20;

// contract address: 0x0000000000000000000011111111111111111111
interface WithdrawalRequests {

    struct WithdrawalRequest {
        MCAddress mcAddress;
        uint256 value;
    }

    function getWithdrawalRequests(uint32 withdrawalEpoch) external view returns (WithdrawalRequest[] memory);

    function submitWithdrawalRequest(MCAddress mcAddress) external payable returns (WithdrawalRequest memory);
}
```

To compile the contract, **WithdrawalRequests.sol**, go to the <code>contracts/</code> directory and run the command:

```
truffle compile
```

Next, get the contract abstraction. Run the command:


```
truffle(zen)> const withdrawalContract = await WithdrawalRequests.at("0x0000000000000000000011111111111111111111")
undefined
```



## Interact with native smart instance 

To interact with a native contract instance, use the method, <strong><code>submitWithdrawalRequest</code></strong>.


```
truffle(zen)> withdrawalContract.submitWithdrawalRequest(mcAddress, { value: 1000000000000 })
```


**Note:** The mcAddress needs to be defined or replaced by the string containing the Horizen mainchain address. 

The target mainchain address of a backward transfer has to be a valid address: starting with “**zn**” for *mainnet* or “**zt**” for *testnet*.
