# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Setup your environment

Create an `.env` file at the root, using `.env.template` as a template.

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory.

> Note: the static content generated by this command is for local testing only. To test it locally you can serve it using the `npm run serve` command.
