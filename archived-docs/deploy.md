# Deploy
*Learn how to deploy a simple Solidity-based smart contract in Gobi Testnet using the Truffle or Hardhat framework.*

## Deploying a Contract using Truffle

Once the DemoToken contract is successfully compiled, it can now be deployed. 
However, before deploying, make sure that the account you plan to use has sufficient ZEN. See [Get Started](/#connect-to-a-wallet) to install the MetaMask wallet, if needed. To deploy a contract on Dune Testnet or Gobi Testnet, your account must have sufficient ZEN. You can get some free test ZEN by using the [**Faucet**](https://faucet.horizen.io/ ).


Add the deployment script, [1_deploy_DEMOToken.js](https://github.com/rocknitive/zen-sidechain-truffle/blob/master/migrations/1_deploy_DemoToken.js)  (below) in the `/migrations` folder:


```
const DemoToken = artifacts.require("DemoToken");

module.exports = function(deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(DemoToken);
};
```


Next, deploy the contract by running the command:


```
truffle migrate --network zen
```



## Interact with a Contract Instance

To interact with your deployed contract, you first need to get the contract instance. First, run the Truffle console again by running the command:

```
truffle console --network zen
```

Then get the contract instance by running the command:
```
truffle(zen)> const contract = await DemoToken.deployed()
```


Next, you will get some information from the ERC20 contract by calling the token methods from [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20). Be aware of the method names by looking at the ABI of the contract or look at the code itself. 


### Get the token name


```
truffle(zen)> contract.name()
'Demo Token'
```



### Get the token symbol


```
truffle(zen)> contract.symbol()
'DEMO'
```



### Get the account balance 

In this example, use the main (first) account, where 20 bytes of an account can be directly specified. 


```
truffle(zen)> const myAccounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts()
truffle(zen)> contract.balanceOf(myAccounts[0])
BN {
  negative: 0,
  words: [ 100, <1 empty item> ],
  length: 1,
  red: null
}
```



### Send token to an account 

Send 12 tokens to the following account:


```
0x03f14683E2f95883815f0df3C9145Efe24575163
```


Here is the code:


```
truffle(zen)> contract.transfer("0x03f14683E2f95883815f0df3C9145Efe24575163", 12)
{
  tx: '0xa19ffcb54152804ed10c778828215d505656d7a112921f11e7c9ffb47c749341',
  receipt: ...,
  logs: ...
}
```


The balance is now reduced by 12 (tokens):


```
truffle(zen)> contract.balanceOf(myAccounts[0])
BN { negative: 0, words: [ 88, <1 empty item> ], length: 1, red: null }
```


 


## EOA to EOA transactions 

Send ZEN from the main address to a known address.


```
truffle(zen)> web3.eth.sendTransaction({ from: myAccounts[0], to: "0x03f14683E2f95883815f0df3C9145Efe24575163", value: 100 })

  status: true,
  effectiveGasPrice: 2500000007
}

```



## Interact with native smart contracts 

There is no difference between interacting with an abstraction of a native smart contract (abstract contract or child contract created from base contract) and a traditional smart contract. In this example, you will send ZEN from an EON EVM address to the Horizen mainchain for two main functionalities (backward transfer and forgers) provided through native smart contracts.

To interact with the native contract, you will use the function, **backward transfer** (also called, **withdrawal request**) at the reserved address as:

<strong><code>0x0000000000000000000011111111111111111111</code></strong> 

You can also send ZEN using the smart contract address and the ABI. In this example, the Solidity file, **WithdrawalRequests.sol** (below) is used to demonstrate the interaction.

You can obtain a copy of the [WithdrawalRequests.sol](https://github.com/rocknitive/zen-sidechain-truffle/blob/master/contracts/WithdrawalRequests.sol) file and put it in the <code>/contracts</code> folder. 

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

type MCAddress is bytes20;

// contract address: 0x0000000000000000000011111111111111111111
interface WithdrawalRequests {

    struct WithdrawalRequest {
        MCAddress mcAddress;
        uint256 value;
    }

    function getWithdrawalRequests(uint32 withdrawalEpoch) external view returns (WithdrawalRequest[] memory);

    function submitWithdrawalRequest(MCAddress mcAddress) external payable returns (WithdrawalRequest memory);
}
```

To compile the contract, **WithdrawalRequests.sol**, go to the <code>contracts/</code> directory and run the command:

```
truffle compile
```

Next, get the contract abstraction. Run the command:


```
truffle(zen)> const withdrawalContract = await WithdrawalRequests.at("0x0000000000000000000011111111111111111111")
undefined
```



## Interact with native smart instance 

To interact with a native contract instance, use the method, <strong><code>submitWithdrawalRequest</code></strong>.


```
truffle(zen)> withdrawalContract.submitWithdrawalRequest(mcAddress, { value: 1000000000000 })
```


**Note:** The mcAddress needs to be defined or replaced by the string containing the Horizen mainchain address. 

The target mainchain address of a backward transfer must be a **valid address** with the following format:

1. Use **zn** for *mainnet* or **zt** for *testnet*.


    Example: ztWBHD2Eo6uRLN6xAYxj8mhmSPbUYrvMPwt


2. The address must be decoded.


    Example: 0x2098212831547ff1a3508ae0d1c79f43bc7920c15ebfbccfefd7


3. Remove the CRC and network identifier (the network identifier is in the first two bytes).


    Example: 0x212831547ff1a3508ae0d1c79f43bc7920c15ebf 

The operation can be performed either with a library (such as a base58 for Javascript, which Horizen does not provide) or with some online editing tools.


In the example below, the mcAddress is 0x212831547ff1a3508ae0d1c79f43bc7920c15ebf.


```

    status: true,
    effectiveGasPrice: 2500000007,
    rawLogs: [ [Object] ]
  },
  logs: []
}

```

## Deploying a Contract using Hardhat
To deploy a contract, you will use a deployment script that is specific for your smart contract. Go to the `script/` folder and find the following deploy.ts file:

### Deploy contract ERC20.sol
To deploy your contract ERC20.sol, create a folder in your Hardhat project and name it, **scripts/**. Copy this script (below) and name it **ERC20.ts**.  

Before you can deploy a contract, you need to add the import statement by running the command:

```
import {ether} from hardhat;
```


Use the deployment script for the contract, ERC20.sol:

```
const deployERC20 = async () => {
   const ERC20 = await ethers.getContractFactory("ERC20"); 
   const erc20 = await ERC20.deploy("Test", "TST");
   await erc20.deployed();
   console.log(erc20.address); 
};
deployERC20();
```

Run the command to deploy the contract:

```
npx hardhat run ./scripts/ERC20.ts
```
You will see the following execution results:

```
0x82534fBC27671eEd1F99d342CAd6be213f541a87
```

### Deploy contract TestPayable.sol

Before you can deploy a contract, you need to add the import statement by running the command:

```
import {ether} from hardhat;
```

To deploy your contract **TestPayable.sol**, create a folder in your Hardhat project and name it, **scripts/**. Copy this script (below) and name it **Payable.ts**.  



```
const deployPayable = async () => {
   const Payable = await ethers.getContractFactory("TestPayable"); 
   const payable = await Payable.deploy();
   await payable.deployed();
   console.log(payable.address);
   await payable.pay({ value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1") });
   console.log((await ethers.provider.getBalance(payable.address)).toString()); };
   return payable.address;
};
```
Run the command to deploy the contract:

```
npx hardhat run ./scripts/Payable.ts
```

You will see the following execution results:

```
0xCE3Ab1fC99a77C4648c9c471c16d4D5e4568cE9A 1000000000000000000
```


## Interact with a Contract Instance

To interact with your deployed smart contract, create a folder in your Hardhat project and name it, **tests/**. You will add test scripts that are specific to your contract instance as well as other contracts.

### Interact with TestPayable: With ABI and Without ABI
Interact with TestPayable by passing the ABI and without passing the ABI. Copy the script (below) into your **test/** folder:

```
const contractInteraction = async () => {
   const payableAddress = await deployPayable();
   // passing the ABI
   const payable = await ethers.getContractAt("TestPayable", payableAddress); 
   await payable.pay({ value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1") });
   // without passing the ABI
   const [sender] = await ethers.getSigners(); 
   await sender.sendTransaction({
      to: payableAddress,
      value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1"), 
   });
   console.log((await ethers.provider.getBalance(payableAddress)).toString()); 
};
contractInteraction();
```

Run the command to interact with this contract instance:

```
npx hardhat test
```

You will see the following execution results:

```
2000000000000000000
```


### Interact with TestPayable: Read → Call 
Interact with TestPayable by using the Read function. Copy the script (below) into your **test/** folder:

```
const read = async () => {
   const payable = await ethers.getContractAt(
      "TestPayable",
      await deployPayable() 
   );
   console.log(await payable.sentence()); 
};
read();
```

Run the command to interact with this contract instance:

```
npx hardhat test
```
You will see the following execution results:

```
This is payable
```

### Interact with TestPayable: Call Non-Payable Function
Interact with TestPayable by calling a non-payable function along with ZEN to verify that an error is thrown (as expected). Copy the script (below) into your **test/** folder:

```
const invalidPayment = async () => {
   const payable = await ethers.getContractAt(
      "TestPayable",
      await deployPayable() 
   );
   // @ts-ignore
   await payable.dontPay({ value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1") }); 
};
invalidPayment();
```

Run the command to interact with this contract instance:

```
npx hardhat test
```

You will see the following execution results:

```

}
```

### Interact with ERC20: Using Approve or Transfer Methods
You can interact with the ERC20 contract instance by using the approve or transfer methods to check for emit events. Copy the script (below) into your **tests/** folder:

```
const testApproveAndTransfer = async () => {
   const testERC20 = await deployTestERC20();
   const receiver = "0xF102765ba64849f77A2AC31a58e787B23480a6E0";
   const approveReceipt = await (await testERC20.approve(receiver, 1)).wait(); 
   const approveEvent = approveReceipt.events?.filter(
(e) => e.event === "Approval" );
   console.log(approveEvent);
   const transferReceipt = await (await testERC20.transfer(receiver, 1)).wait(); 
   const transferEvent = transferReceipt.events?.filter(
(e) => e.event === "Transfer" );
   console.log(transferEvent); 
};
testApproveAndTransfer();
```

Run the command to interact with this contract instance:

```
npx hardhat test
```
You will see the following execution results:

getTransaction: [Function (anonymous)],
getTransactionReceipt: [Function (anonymous)] }
]
```

### Interact with ERC20: EOA to EOA Transaction
You can also interact with the ECR20 contract instance by making an EOA to EOA transaction. Copy the script (below) into your **tests/** folder:

```
const eoaToEoa = async () => {
   const receiver = "0xF102765ba64849f77A2AC31a58e787B23480a6E0"; 
   console.log(`Receiver balance before: ${(await ethers.provider.getBalance(receiver)).toString()}` );
   const [sender] = await ethers.getSigners(); 
   await sender.sendTransaction({
      to: receiver,
      value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1"), 
   });
   console.log(`Receiver balance after: ${(await ethers.provider.getBalance(receiver)).toString()}`); 
};
eoaToEoa();
```

Run the command to interact with this contract instance:

```
npx hardhat test
```

You will see the following execution results:

```
Receiver balance before: 0
Receiver balance after: 1000000000000000000
```

## Connect to a dApp
To connect your smart contract to an external client, such as your dApp or MetMask, you first need to run the Hardhat Network as a standalone. Run the Hardhat Network by running the command:

```
npx hardhat node
```
You will see the following:

```
$ npx hardhat node
Started HTTP and WebSocket JSON-RPC server at http://127.0.0.1:9045/
```
This exposes a JSON-RPC interface to the Hardhat Network. Use the address, **http://127.0.0.1:9045/** in your dApp.

**Note:** The port number may vary.  Check in your ***.conf** file.

## Deploying a Contract using Remix IDE

Once you have compiled your smart contract, use the Deploy and Run module to run and send transactions to the current environment. 

Perform the following steps to run and deploy your smart contract:

1. In the **Icon panel**, click the **Deploy and Run** icon. The **Deploy and Run module** appears in the **side panel**.

![deployrun](/img/docs/deploy/deployrun.png)

2. For EON, configure the **Deploy and Run module** settings with the following:

**Environment** - Click the drop-down menu to select the **Injected Provider** option.
This option allows Remix to use your wallet (e.g. MetaMask). Your wallet must be active and running.  The Environment option details information about your wallet, such as the ChainID.

**Note:** Make sure that **Gobi Testnet** is selected as the current environment in your wallet. See the [Get Started](https://eon.horizen.io/docs/) section for details on configuring Gobi Testnet to your wallet.

By default, the **Remix VM** (previously called JavaScript VM) is used to connect to a sandbox blockchain in the web browser. The London version refers to the London fork of Ethereum. 

**Account** - Click the drop-down menu to display a list of accounts associated with the current environment (and their associated balances). Since the Environment option is set to the **Injected Provider**, the list displays the available account(s) in your wallet. This is the account where the smart contract is deployed from. 

**Gas Limit** - This field sets the maximum amount of gas that will be allowed for all the transactions created in Remix. The Gas Limit value can be **ignored** at this time.

**Value** - This field sets the amount of **ZEN**. Given that Remix is a tool for Ethereum, the tokens listed in the drop-down menu reflect the amount of digits you wish to use for the value that is sent to a contract or a payable function.

Select one of the symbol you wish for the ZEN token conversion:

| Symbol/Unit | Value to use |
| ------ | ------ |
| Wei | ZEN x 10<sup>18</sup> |
| Gwei | ZEN x 10<sup>9</sup> |
| Ether | ZEN |

The **Value** field is always reset to 0 after each transaction execution. This field **DOES NOT** include gas.

3. Click **Deploy**. The **Deployed Contract** pane displays your contract set as TESTCONTRACT and location. This indicates that your smart contract is deployed and ready for interaction.

### Interact with a Contract Instance

Interacting with your smart contract can be a simple transaction, such as sending some amount of Ether to trigger an action, unlike a generic smart contract method call, where a transaction will change the state of the EVM.

Perform the following steps to interact with run your smart contract:

1. In the **Deployed Contract** pane, click on the **right arrow** next to the filename to expand. In this example, the filename is TESTCONTRACT. The functions of the deployed contract are displayed.

![threebuttons](/img/docs/deploy/threebuttons.png)

Upon expanding the pane, your contract instance displays three actions that corresponds to the functions:

**SetNP (orange button)** - This is a non-payable function, where it is not possible to send value (ZEN) to the contract.

**SetP (red button)** - This is a payable function that sends value (ZEN) to the contract instance.

**get (blue button)** - The get function does not execute a transaction, therefore it does not change the state (the value variable in your contract) of your contract instance. However, it is a view function and a return value is shown.

2. Click on the **down arrow** next to the **setP** field to expand the function.

![expandfunction](/img/docs/deploy/expandfunction.png)

#### Non-Payable Functions

For **non-payable functions**, DO NOT specify a value other than zero (0). Any value more than 0 is not accepted by the smart contract and the transaction will fail.

![nonpayfunction](/img/docs/deploy/nonpayablefunction.png)

#### Payable Functions

For **payable functions**, you can specify an amount of ZEN in the Value field to be paid to the smart contract. A successful execution of the transaction subtracts this value amount including the required fees for a *normal* smart contract method call.

![payfunction](/img/docs/deploy/payablefunction.png)

If any issues arise, the Remix IDE will provide a status notification before confirming the operation.

![confirmation](/img/docs/deploy/confirmation.png)

3. In the expanded function (**setP**), enter a **desired value** in the **value** field.  

   **Note:** Initially, the fields, **setP** and **setNP** display *uint256*. This indicates that it is expecting an unsigned integer (256 bit) type to store non-negative integers.  

4. Click **transact**. The Terminal panel displays a success status for the interaction with your smart contract.

## Verifying a Smart Contract

Any deployed smart contract can be verified using the EON Explorer.  The verification process begins with submitting the smart contract's source code to EON Explorer. The EON Explorer compares the submitted source code with the deployed byte code. If there is a match, then the smart contract is verified successfully, whereby the EON Explorer generates an interface to call the methods of the contract.

**Note:** It is highly recommended that you use the **Chrome web browser** to interact with the **EON Explorer** for optimized user experience.

The major steps for verifying a smart contract are:

* Deploy a smart contract to the Gobi Testnet network


**Note:** See the [Build](https://eon.horizen.io/docs/build) section for details on compiling and deploying a smart contract.

* Flatten the smart contract, if needed
* Check for the deployed contract using the EON Explorer
* Verify and publish the contract

Make sure that you deploy your contract to the Gobi Testnet. If you are using a wallet, you must connect it to the Gobi Testnet network.

Use the following parameters to connect to Gobi Testnet:

```
Network name:  Gobi Testnet 
New RPC URL:  https://gobi-testnet.horizenlabs.io/ethv1 
Chain ID: 1663 
Currency symbol: ZEN
```

In this exercise, the [EON Explorer](https://gobi-explorer.horizen.io/) is connected to the Gobi Testnet. The smart contract was developed and deployed to the Gobi Testnet network. The verification process will be performed using the **Via flattened source code** option in the EON Explorer.

### Flatten the Smart Contract

Before using the EON Explorer for verification, make sure the Gobi Testnet network has the deployed smart contract you want to verify. You need to flatten the smart contract if the contract inherits from other contracts or if it uses a library. Flattening a smart contract refers to combining all Solidity code into one file instead of multiple source files, thereby having the imported code be embedded in the same file. 

All smart contract development tools have a source code flattener. For example: 

* **Truffle** - uses the [Truffle Flattener](https://www.npmjs.com/package/truffle-flattener)
* **Hardhat** - uses the [Hardhat Flattener](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/advanced/flattening) 
* The [POA Solidity Flattener](https://github.com/poanetwork/solidity-flattener) can be used to flatten a smart contract
* **Remix** - provides a built-in flattener tool
 
**Note:** In the **Remix Explorer**, select your smart contract file ( **.sol** ) to flatten, then right-click on the flattener tool. 

### Check for the Deployed Contract

In the [EON Explorer](https://gobi-explorer.horizen.io/), perform the following steps to begin the verification process:

1. Once you have deployed your contract, your developer tool will display the address the network has assigned your contract to. Copy that address.

2. Open the EON Explorer and paste the contract address into the **Search** field.

![alt_text](/img/docs/deploy/contract-address.png)

3. The **Contract Address Details** page appears. Review the information displayed. In the lower pane, click **Code**.

![alt_text](/img/docs/deploy/address-details.png)

4. The **Contract Creation Code** page appears. Click **Verify & Publish**. 

![alt_text](/img/docs/deploy/verify-publish.png)

5. The **New Smart Contract Verification** page appears. It displays the contract address and various methods for verifying. By default, the **Via flattened source code** is selected.

![alt_text](/img/docs/deploy/viaflattenedsource.png)

6. In the **New Smart Contract Verification** page, click **Next**. A form page appears. 

![alt_text](/img/docs/deploy/verifyform.png)

Set the form with the following:

  * **Contract name:** The name of the class called in the **.sol** file is the contract name. For example, *Owner* is the contract name.

  * **Include Nightly Builds:** By default, **No** is selected. Change only to **Yes** for nightly builds.

  * **Compiler:** Make sure that you select the same version that you used to compile your contract.

  * **EVM Version:** See the EVM version information. In this example, it is **default**.

  * **Optimization:** Set to **No** unless you explicitly chose *optimization* when you compiled your contract.

  * **Enter the Solidity Contract Code:** Enter your Solidity contract code in this field. For example, the content of the **Token.sol** file is entered. 

  * **Try to fetch constructor arguments automatically:** By default, **Yes** is enabled. If similar contracts exist, their constructor arguments may be available.

  * **ABI-encoded Constructor Arguments:** See the [ABI Constructor Arguments](https://docs.blockscout.com/for-users/abi-encoded-constructor-arguments) for detailed information. 

  * **Add Contract Libraries:** Enter the **name** and **0x address** of any required libraries called in the **.sol** file. If your contract is  flattened, you do not need to add a contract library.

7. Click **Verify & publish**. A checkmark symbol appears next to the **Code** tab if successful. Also, the **Read Contract** tab and the **Write Contract** tab will appear.

  **Note:** It is recommended **NOT** to use the **Brave web browser** for **EON Explorer** contract verification because of interface limitations.
  
8. Click the **Read Contract** tab or **Write Contract** tab to display and interact with the contract details and any related transactions.
